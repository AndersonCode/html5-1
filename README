Html5 on Rails
=====

This plugin is a bit of a playground to see what html goodies we can do. I'm implementing things as I desire them, and not in any normal order.

Current Features
=======

Since the type attributes for CSS and javascript tags have sensible defaults, we can omit them unless we need to override them.
<script src="/javascripts/all.js"></script>
<link href="/stylesheets/boilerplate.css?1238073247" media="all" rel="stylesheet" />
