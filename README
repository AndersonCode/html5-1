HTML5 on Rails
=====

by Daniel Morrison, Collective Idea

This plugin is a bit of a playground to see what html goodies we can do. I'm implementing things as I desire them, and not in any normal order.

Current Features
=======

New form field helpers for new field types (all work as text fields in browsers that don't support them): 
  email_field
  url_field
  search_field
  number_field
  range_field

Since the type attributes for CSS and javascript tags have sensible defaults, we can omit them unless we need to override them.
<script src="/javascripts/all.js"></script>
<link href="/stylesheets/main.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet">

Don't self-close tags. This allows us to have <img src="foo.png"> instead of <img src="foo.png" />. Of course you'll need that if you're serving your pages as application/xhtml+xml, but if you know what that means, you'll probably know how to override it.

Rails Version
=======

This is currently built for Rails 2.x. I'll update it for 3.0 when I have time, but patches are always welcome!
